### Considered using Ionic.
Gives easy access to mobile-friendly UI tools & still offer the unified experience on for all users (web/iOS/Android). 

Decided not to; 4 hours is a relatively short time, the first requirement is for the videos to be accessible through web URL based navigation. This would require extra work in Ionic and is not a mobile-friendly form of navigation at all.
An alternative would be to build a mobile navigation interface, but that would cost too much time.
