## Considered using Ionic.
Gives easy access to mobile-friendly UI tools & still offer the unified experience on for all users (web/iOS/Android). 

Decided not to; 4 hours is a relatively short time, the first requirement is for the videos to be accessible through web URL based navigation. This would require extra work in Ionic and is not a mobile-friendly form of navigation at all.
An alternative would be to build a mobile navigation interface, but that would cost too much time.

## Optimizing the way mapping is parsed
Currently the file is being parsed & sorted on every request of a single post.

Parsing it in a static class & storing the result in a single place would speed up this part of the application.

If we wish to have more control over the way parsing is done, it would be a good idea to move the parsing & sorting to a separate file entirely, and have the Post only have to request the correct mapping of its own ID.

## Finding out why we need the `rexml` gem
Before adding it, the following error occurred when running Rspec:
```
An error occurred while loading ./spec/models/post_spec.rb.
Failure/Error: require File.expand_path('../config/environment', __dir__)

LoadError:
  cannot load such file -- rexml/document
# ./config/application.rb:20:in `<top (required)>'
# ./config/environment.rb:2:in `require_relative'
# ./config/environment.rb:2:in `<top (required)>'
# ./spec/rails_helper.rb:4:in `<top (required)>'
# ./spec/models/post_spec.rb:1:in `<top (required)>'
```

The internet did not provide any useful information, and adding the `rexml` gem was just a wild guess. It's working now, but I'd have liked to spend more time on figuring out what is going on here.

## Less embedded javascript
Due to me already spending a lot of time (~30 minutes) fixing RSpec errors, I did not want to spend a lot more time on fiddling with Rails.

I decided to embed all of my JavaScript on the 'show' page. Ideally I would have moved the scripts over to separate files.

## Tested javascript
Due to me already spending a lot of time on setup of frameworks, javascript testing has been skipped and has all been done manually.

## All of the interaction with the Placeholdd API in one spot
Currently, the parts of this application that read from the Placeholdd API are all located in Rails and done by the `activeresource` gem.
The parts of this application that update the Placeholdd API are all located in embedded Javascript on the Show page.

Ideally, this API interaction would be unified in one location, so that if the API ever changes, you only have to change one part of the application.

## Remove more boilerplate code
There's a lot of unused code generated by the Rails scaffolding. Ideally, I'd have spent some time removing that unused code, but there was not enough time to do so.

## Re-implement caching
Using the navigation buttons to move around on the website to other videos broke the embedded javascript when caching was enabled through Turbolinks.

Ideally, we would cache the unchanging parts of the pages in the client's memory, but there was no time to ensure this did not break those scripts, so Turbolinks has been removed entirely.

## Improve navigation UI
Currently, there is a **Back** button on each page that returns you to the index showing all pages. It's ugly, and so is the index page.

## Remove debugging information
Currently, the post ID and mediaclip ID are shown above the video. At the 40% mark and at the end of the video, a logging message also appears in the Javscript console.

## No message shown when no associated mediaclip
Currently, when there is no associated mediaclip with a post ID, no video element is shown, and no error message is shown either.

The page looks very broken, and ideally there would be something shown to the user to let them know what is going on.
